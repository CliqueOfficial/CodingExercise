# Clique Coding Execise Case 1

## Set up and run project

This project is a simple GraphQL service written in NestJS framework. We build it with code-first method, which means the schema.gql in the root directory is generated by code every time when the codebase is built. As a side note, we prefer yarn over npm. You can build and run the project with the following commands.

```bash
# install packages
$ yarn
# run project
$ yarn start
```

After running the above commands, you should be able to get a GraphQL playground under http://localhost:3000/graphql. Below is a sample query:

```js
query RecipeQuery {
  recipe(id: "1") {
    id
    title
    description
    ingredients
    creationDate
    forNumPeople
  }
}
```

## Question

1. Could you update the code such that it can attach a condition to each field and returns true when the condition is met, false otherwise.

2. Examples of such conditions: 
    1. Check if a cuisine is for 5 people, and it should return true/false for the field recipe.forNumPeople.
    2. Check if a cuisine description contains 'Sichuan'.
